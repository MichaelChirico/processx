# FIFOs

## Unix FIFOs

In Unix a FIFO is an interprocess communication device with a star-topology.
(That's right, a FIFO can have multiple readers and writers.) It has an entry in the file system, although most of the time the data in the FIFO is never written to the disk.

Unix FIFO operations:

1.  Creating the FIFO in the file system. `mkfifo(2)` system call.
2.  Opening the FIFO. `open(2)`.
3.  Polling the FIFO. We use normal `poll(2)` as for everything else.
4.  Reading from the FIFO. `read(2)`.
5.  Writing to the FIFO. `write(2)` and friends.
6.  Closing the FIFO. `close(2)`.

## Blocking vs Non-blocking mode

The processx functions support opening the FIFO in blocking and non-blocking mode.
Blocking mode is not very useful because `open()` will block until the other side of the FIFO is `open()`-d by at least one process.
This is cumbersome to ensure and can often lead to deadlocks.
E.g. the other process fails to start and connect to the FIFO, and then we block fovever.

Blocking processx FIFOs are not tested very well, and unless noted otherwise this document is about non-blocking FIFOs.

## processx's FIFOs on Unix

`conn_create_fifo()` first creates the FIFO with `mkfifo(2)` (1 above) and then opens it with `open(2)` (2 above).
If `read = TRUE` then this is the reader end (*a* reader end, really), if `write = TRUE` then it is the writer.
For the writer end, we need to open non-blocking FIFOs for read-write, because otherwise the `open()` fails if the FIFO does not have a reader.
Weird, but this is how it is on Unix.
Even weirder, according to POSIX, opening a FIFO in read-write mode is undefined behavior.
On Linux the documented behavior is that `O_RDWR` does succeeds even if there is no reader (well, there is now).
Apparently, this is also the bevarios on macOS.
Many people say on the internet, and this is the standard behavior on all Unix systems.

`conn_connect_fifo()` connects to an existing FIFO using `open(2)` (2 above).
(Created by processx or not.) Just like `conn_create_fifo()` it opens the FIFO in read-write mode instead of write-only mode.
This helps with the situations when the FIFO file exists but no reader is connected to it (yet).
On Unix `conn_connect_fifo()` fails if the FIFO file does not exist, or we have no permissions to open it in the specified mode.

The rest of the operations (3-6 above) are the usual processx connection operations, there is nothing special about FIFO connections once they are opened.

## Emulating FIFOs with named pipes on Windows

Windows does not quite have the equivalent of FIFOs, but we can reasonably emulate them with named pipes.

`conn_create_fifo()` creates a named pipe with `CreateNamedPipeA()` with the specified name.
This corresponds to creating the FIFO and opening it (1-2 above).

`conn_connect_fifo()` opens a named pipe, like a regular file, with `CreateFileA()` (2 above).

Once opened, the FIFOs work like regular connections.
Well, mostly.
See the notes about known platform differences below!

## How-to

#### How to check if the other write-end of the FIFO is connected?

If you have the read end, then use `poll()` to see if there is data in the FIFO.
There is no way to know currently when the other end connects, but once it writes data, `poll()` will return `ready` .

#### How to check if the other read-end of the FIFO is connected?

If you have the write end, then unfortunately there is no easy way to make sure that the other end is connected.
You can try to write to the FIFO, and on Unix it might succeed, and on Windows it might fail.
If you need to make sure that there is a reader at the other end, then you'll need another FIFO in the opposite direction, where the reader can send a message about being connected.
(Or some other way to communicate this.) This is admittedly not great, and make it much more difficult to use FIFOs.

#### How to check for end-of-FIFO?

This is as usual.
A non-blocking read returns zero bytes if there is no more data and there are no more writers connected to the FIFO.
On Unix maybe there will be more writers later, but processx does not care about that.
Once a connection is set to EOF, it is EOF.
`conn_is_incomplete()` returns `FALSE` if EOF is set.
(As usual, it only makes sense to check this after a `read()`.

#### How to communicate with another process?

Create a FIFO with `conn_create_fifo()` then pass the name of the FIFO (you can use `conn_file_name()` to the other program.
It is a piece of text, so you can pass it as an argument.
(But watch out for special characters, especially on Windows. It is best to use processx and avoid system.) The other program can open the FIFO (for reading or writing) as a regular file with `open()`, `fopen()`, `CreateFile()`, etc.
It can open it in blocking or non-blocking mode, as needed.
If you need bidirectional communication, then use two FIFOs.

## Platform differences and portable code

-   Do not connect more than one reader or more than one writer to a FIFO.
    While this is fine on Unix, and it is pretty cool, actually, it will fail on Windows.

-   Remember that once there are zero readers or writers on a FIFO, the other end will signal EOF at the next read (or poll!) operation.

-   `conn_read_*()` will fail on Windows if the other end or the FIFO is not connected.
    Always use `poll()` first and only read if it returns `ready`.
    `poll()` will not return `ready` if the other end of the FIFO is not connected.

-   `conn_write()` may fail (on Windows) if the other end of the FIFO is not connected yet and also if there are no more writers.
    (But this does not always happen, e.g. if we opened the FIFO in read-write mode in the first place!) Be prepared that every `conn_write()` call can fail.

-   As usual `conn_write()` might not be able to write all data if the pipe/FIFO buffer is full, and it will return the un-written `raw()` data.
    Make sure to check the return value of `conn_write()`.

-   A `poll()` on a FIFO can return `ready` and then have no data on the next `conn_read_*()`, at least on Windows.
    This is because at the first `poll()` (on Windows) we need to start an asynchronous operation for waiting for the other end of the pipe to connect.
    Once this returns, `poll()` will signal `ready`, but there might be no data to read just yet.

## Known issues

-   Non-ASCII file names or pipe name are currently an issue.
    (Just like non-ASCII file name in `conn_create_file()` are!)

-   Encodings of the pipe traffic are very little tested.
